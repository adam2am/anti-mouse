nice question about an overkill -
# whats needed here, whats actually needed while this stage, could be soo fcking great + supporting a main idea, makes so much sense
== probably:



## currently:

// refining, i dont like the "," as a target option, just gonn delete it? to see whats up
potentially => setup ;settings == opening up the textbox with all the manual settings, current map etc


--- angle, potentially storing the position of the subcell for each monitor as an extra option
        if monitor 1 - EBN, monitor 2 could be just EB
        it has to detect the positon of current cursor (which monitor)



## further:
- 2 - better shortcuts + way of handling within a cell... how?
because its, well, conflicting with 1/2 numbers (multi-monitor), 
and also not covering full range being lil bit not precise within the cell, what are the pottential options here?


/ CVBNM - not used, 
/ but if to keep those and make 4x4 subgrids =  1 - C CC VV V?  //  2 - C CV VC V? (chords)

-- another option could be 
/ qwerty - 1/3 top
/ asdfg - 1/3 mid
/ zxcvb - 1/3 bot
-- but it doesn't do anything about the fast precision



- 3 - darker theme (sometimes cant see a letters) = I like mouseless (windows one)

- 4 - ability to JLK cursor, scroll and click it like in firefox






# ok, imma keep those:
- 1 - regular grid feels soo much nicer when different hands (ql / is etc),
but when the same hand (qa, es), feels not smooth at all     
// angle: to make it more differentiated by hand 
/         = 1 letter for a left one, 2nd for a right one

- /caps1/caps2 potential nicer more intuitive shortcuts between monitors


# checked, not really working:
- 1 - caps+q to caps+tab => reverse, annoying shortcut
