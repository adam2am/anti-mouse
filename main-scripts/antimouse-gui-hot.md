nice question about an overkill -
# whats needed here, whats actually needed while this stage, could be soo fcking great + supporting a main idea, makes so much sense
== probably:



## currently:
### wanna finish this week max, too much time on it (#4m #1w #5fr #2025 / #2025_04_04 #spring)

- on doulbe caps make it on 2nd press, not on realease


- 2 - more precise sub-cells + better shortcuts overall, 
nicer way of handling within a cell... how?
because its, well, conflicting with 1/2 numbers (multi-monitor), 
and also not covering full range being lil bit not precise within the cell, what are the pottential options here?


/ CVBNM - not used, 
/ but if to keep those and make 4x4 subgrids =  1 - C CC VV V?  //  2 - C CV VC V? (chords)




## further:

-  0 - choosing which one side I dont need to save position of a subcell for 
/ choosing what cells I gotta save position for?
/ == if often visiting this thing

        - saving state of subcell not working 100% of the time. 
        probably dont even need it
        / deleting saving previous subcell position?
        / just choose what cell I wanna save position for in settings? = like with a chat q.


- 1 - more robust activation overall based on analysis of a logic flow

-- another option could be 
/ qwerty - 1/3 top
/ asdfg - 1/3 mid
/ zxcvb - 1/3 bot
-- but it doesn't do anything about the fast precision


- 3 - storing favorite positions where to click?
        Alt+Caps+1/2/3/4/5/6?
        or some other key bindings?


- 3 - darker theme (sometimes cant see a letters) = I like mouseless (windows one)

- 4 - ability to JLK cursor, scroll and click it like in firefox






# ok, imma keep those:

#4m #1w #5fr #2025 / #2025_04_04 #spring
potentially 
=> setup hotstring ;settings 
== opening up the textbox with all the manual settings, current map + modes etc


// refining, i dont like the "," as a target option, just gonn delete it? to see whats up


--- angle, potentially storing the position of the subcell for each monitor as an extra option
        if monitor 1 - EBN, monitor 2 could be just EB
        it has to detect the positon of current cursor (which monitor)


- 1 - regular grid feels soo much nicer when different hands (ql / is etc),
but when the same hand (qa, es), feels not smooth at all     
// angle: to make it more differentiated by hand 
/         = 1 letter for a left one, 2nd for a righ1t one

- /caps1/caps2 potential nicer more intuitive short11cuts between monitors


# checked, not really working:
- 1 - caps+q to caps+tab => reverse, annoying shortcut
