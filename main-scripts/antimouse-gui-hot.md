nice question about an overkill -
# whats needed here, whats actually needed while this stage, could be soo fcking great + supporting a main idea 
== probably:

- 1 - caps+q to caps+tab/caps1/caps2 nicer shortcuts, between monitors, more intuitive

- 2 - better shortcuts + way of handling within a cell 
because its, well, conflicting with 1/2 numbers (multi-monitor), 
and also not covering full range being lil bit not precise within the cell 

- 3 - darker theme (sometimes cant see a letters) = I like mouseless

- 4 - ability to JLK cursor, scroll and click it like in firefox
