# Scenario 1: Instant Backspace

I'm typing something and did a misstype,
instantly wanna do the backspace but without a backspace,
cuz there is too much movement with a finger to the right

- Is easily accessible without hand movement.
- Doesn't interfere with normal typing.
- Is reliably detectable by the system and AutoHotkey.
mostly I enjoy a backspace as a ; cuz its instantly on your finger



## Options:

- Caps as a PowerButton ; -- sometimes messing up with a shift cuz its too close 
        potential approach: doubleCaps as a new Shift
- RAlt as a PowerButton ; -- thumb is too much of a motion there as well, doesnt feel right
- VisualMode like in VIM? -- 3 cicks more, too much actions



## IdeasSugg:
        - Caps, but double Caps as a Shift
        - DoubleShift? - 17-12-2024 - that way builds Ctrl+A better then > Shift+Shift+A+A
        - DoubleChords? - jk
