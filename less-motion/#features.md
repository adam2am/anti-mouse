# Current
- potentially for shift instead of 2xCaps == Caps+Tab/Caps+Shift hold to be sure about pressing it and not mess up with just CapsLock
- Caps + Shift still working, it shouldn't be like that, Caps+Shift+V is not working as well




# Potential, further Ideas
- in any mode - Ctrl+MM - map to jump in any mode
- in any mode - caps + ff = find forward, caps + fb = find backwards? fj - as a jump
- vim-like macros a-w-d = select word delete

- Caps + ~ = Alt+~ terminal activation
- Caps+S+/ = Ctrl+Enter
- Caps+Shift+/ = Ctrl+Shift+Enter
- is there a better idea for a shift? or just have to get used to it? Caps+ Tabto


## Hotstrings entering the arena
- ;dpp = delete previous paragraph, as a hotstring, not as a hotkey
- do we do anything about the "-_/+=" as a hotkey?
- Caps + 1/2/3 = as Alt + 1/2/3 to switch editors




# Completed already
#12m #5w #2024
- alt+tab lost it functionality cuz it's sending tab when detected in combination with CapsLock
        : made the Hotif context for a tab activation
        = as a result, its not touching the regular tab
        

#12m #4w #2024
+ ctrl + u as vim-like undo
+ double caps > shift (working integrated, but not every button, especially when layout switched / KR-EN-CN)
        for multiple cross-layout RU-EN support, changed it all to VK code
        + map for the cross-binds so its not interrupting with each other
+ tab as expected - but its sending only tab in alt-tab
+ delete to d, and backspace little bit further to ' so no missclick when moving, potentially [ as a delete cuz its above the '
