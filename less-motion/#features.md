# Current
- + double caps > shift (working integrated, but not every button, especially when layout switched / KR-EN-CN)
        - potentially change it all to VK code
- alt+tab lost it functionality





# Potential, further Ideas
- in any mode - Ctrl+MM - map to jump in any mode
- in any mode - caps + ff = find forward, caps + fb = find backwards 
- vim-like macros a-w-d = select word delete

- Caps+S+/ = Ctrl+Enter





# Completed already
#12m #4w #2024
+ tab as expected
+ delete to d, and backspace little bit further to ' so no missclick when moving, potentially [ as a delete cuz its above the '
