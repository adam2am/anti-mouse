# Current
- alt+tab lost it functionality cuz it's sending tab when detected in combination with CapsLock
- potentially for shift instead of 2xCaps == Caps+Tab/Caps+Shift hold to be sure about pressing it and not mess up with just CapsLock




# Potential, further Ideas
- in any mode - Ctrl+MM - map to jump in any mode
- in any mode - caps + ff = find forward, caps + fb = find backwards 
- vim-like macros a-w-d = select word delete

- Caps+S+/ = Ctrl+Enter





# Completed already
#12m #4w #2024

+ ctrl + u as vim-like undo
+ double caps > shift (working integrated, but not every button, especially when layout switched / KR-EN-CN)
        for multiple cross-layout RU-EN support, changed it all to VK code
        + map for the cross-binds so its not interrupting with each other
+ tab as expected - but its sending only tab in alt-tab
+ delete to d, and backspace little bit further to ' so no missclick when moving, potentially [ as a delete cuz its above the '
